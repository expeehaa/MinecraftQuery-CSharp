# Minecraft Server Query
This is a simple project to use the Query protocol Minecraft servers provide within a C# project. More information about this protocol can be found here: http://wiki.vg/Query

## How to use
To use the MinecraftQuery class in your project you can just copy the source file into your project (I won't make a NuGet package as it would be too small to make sense for me).
You can modify it however you want, but you may not remove the mention of my copyright on the original file or whatever headers I'll add to it.

The class was written with .NET Core v2.0 though it might be useable with some versions of the .NET-Framework. If you want to use it with that just try it out.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, do it and create a pull request or create an issue, I'll probably see it.
